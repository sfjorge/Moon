# EZ Runner
#### For the sake of clarity, I am a track runner for my high school Doral Academy. My junior year I became really involved in it and did my best to improve; howefver, almost every practice there was a constant ussue that kept reoccuring. What time should I hit in this workout?
#### My coach would give us a time to hit as a group for each sprint but it wasn’t always reliable since, for some of us, that time was too easy to hit and for others it was nearly impossible. That’s why I created this app. 
#### EZ Runner is Web Based app that, based on your fastest competition time sprint, it determines the workout times that you need to hit to benefit the most from eash rep.
