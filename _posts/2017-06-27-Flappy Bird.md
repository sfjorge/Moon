# Flappy Bird
#### This is one of my first Python projects in which I used the Pygame game engine. A game engine is simply a library that facilitates game development. I made this project with the goal of enhancing my skills in the Python language. For anyone interested in learning a new coding language (or learning in general), I would recommend creating games. Programming, then, will no longer be a means of problem solving, but improving and enhancement, making learning more of an entertaining subject. Feel free to check out my code in my github through the link below!
