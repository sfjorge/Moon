## Junior Year 2017-2018
* AP Calculus AB
* AP Physics 1 Algebra-Based
* AP Physics 2 Algebra-Based
* AP Language and Composition
* AP Computer Science Principles
* Honors US History
* Study Hall
##### This year to me seems to be the most challenging and requiring nearly maximum effort. Even though it may seem difficult for most people having to take two AP phyisics courses in the same year, I see it possible for me to succeed with the fact that I have an interest in the field of physics, such as in computer software development. Having this interest will aid me in studying for it. I have noticed it's easier for me to learn when I'm interested in what it is I'm learning, but Physics still contains a lot of content and will require much of my time.. The previous year I learned a good amount of Calculus AB so that wouldn't require too much of my time studying. However, AP Language and Composition is another class that will require a strong focus since it consists of a lot of writing, analysis, and reading. I also took AP Computer Science A my Sophmore year and received a 4 on the AP Exam. This makes me more than qualified for the AP Computer Science Principals class which is basically an introduction class to AP Computer Sciemce A. Finally, I chose Honors US History not to end up pushing myself with another AP class.

## Senior Year 2018-2019
* AP Calculus BC
* AP Physics C
* AP Chemistry
* AP Literature and Composition
* AP Statistics
* Economics
* Study Hall
##### I recently received my AP scores from the tests I took my Sophmore year and noticed what majors specific AP classes are good for. After looking into the major 'Computer Software Engineering', I noticed that I'm only missing a couple more AP courses to have taken all of the ones that have to do with my major of interest. The classes that I am considering for my senior have been chosen baased off of this consideration.
