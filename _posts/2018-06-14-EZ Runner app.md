# EZ Runner
<p> For the sake of clarity, I am a track runner for my high school: Doral Academy. My junior year I became really involved in it and did my best to improve; however, almost every practice there was a constant issue that kept reoccuring. What time should I hit in this workout?</p>
<p> My coach would give us a time to hit as a group for each sprint but it wasn’t always reliable since, for some of us, that time was too easy to hit and for others it was nearly impossible. That’s why I created this app. </p>
<p> EZ Runner is Web Based app that, based on your fastest competition time, it determines the workout times that you should hit to benefit the most from each rep.</p>
